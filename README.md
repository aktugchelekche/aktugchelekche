Hi,

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page.
A bit about me â€¦

I consider myself a data science enthusiast who is always eager to learn new topics and implement new ideas.
I also write about data science, machine learning, deep learning and statistics.
I am passionate about Machine Learning, transforming raw data into useful formats, telling stories through powerful visualizations and meaningful reports ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰
I am recently a student Data Science/Analytics BootCamp at Rice University and completed IBM Data Science Nanodegree Program where I gained technical programming and analytical skills and developed essential industry ingenuity through real-world projects and team collaborations. Feel free to take a look at [my repositories](https://github.com/aktugchelekche?tab=repositories)
